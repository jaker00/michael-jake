		    	 CTD has many wonderful classes ranging from 21<sup>st</sup> Century Literature to classes about HTML and CSS. One of the resources needed to be a part of CTD's HTML and CSS class is <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a></i>.

		    	Our first concern here at CTD is student health. So somehting that the RAs often remind the students is to drink much H<sub>2</sub>O.
